# Spark
Spark framework
Spark is a basic Java api for creating REST services.

The main building block of a Spark application is a set of routes. A route is made up of three simple pieces:
1. A verb (get, post, put, delete, head, trace, connect, options)
2. A path (/hello, /users/:name)
3. A callback (request, response) -> { }
